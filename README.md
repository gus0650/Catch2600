CATCH2600

a very simple game
for the Atari 2600
written in Batari BASIC
by Gustaf Stechmann
in 2025.

This is a very simple game where you must control a bat left/right using the paddle controller, and catch balls falling from the sky.

Think of it as a very much simplified version of "Breakout" or "Kaboom!".

I wrote this game for my kids who are very little, as a training excercise to get accustomed to the paddle controller.

Set difficulty switch to A to increase the speed of the ball.

Enjoy!
